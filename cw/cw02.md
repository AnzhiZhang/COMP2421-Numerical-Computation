## Part 2: Free answer questions (11 marks)

Please upload a single **pdf** file containing the answers to all parts of question 5. Code and tables should be included in-line (no screen shots, no dark backgrounds). You should clearly label each part of your answer.

5.  Consider the problem of heating a one dimensional (i.e., long and thin) rod which has length $1\,\mathrm{m}$. We will set the temperature at one end equal to $20^\circ\,\mathrm{C}$ and to the other end at $80^\circ\,\mathrm{C}$ and see how the temperature evolves over time. In this question we will explore the properties of different numerical methods to approximate the temperature at time $T = 10\, \mathrm{seconds}$.

    ![Schematic of a rod](../_static/img/cw02/rod.svg)

    To model this we split the rod up into $N-1$ small sections each of length $h := 1/(N-1)$, as shown in the picture, and denote the temperature at the end of each section to be $x_i$ for $i = 0, \ldots, N-1$. The temperature at each end is fixed so $x_0(t) = 20$ and $x_{N-1}(t) = 80$ for all times. The temperatures evolve according to the system of differential equation:

	$$
    x_i'(t) = \frac{x_{i-1}(t) - 2 x_{i}(t) + x_{i+1}(t)}{h^2} \mbox{ for } i = 1, \ldots, N-2.
    $$

	Equivalently, denoting $\vec{x}(t) = (x_0(t), x_1(t), \ldots, x_{N-1}(t))$ we can write this system as

	$$
    \vec{x}'(t) = \vec{f}(\vec{x}, t) = A \vec{x}(t),
    $$

	where

	$$
    A_{ij} = \begin{cases}
    1 / h^2 & \mbox{ if } j = i-1, \mbox{ for } 1 \le i \le N-2 \\
    -2 / h^2 & \mbox{ if } j = i, \mbox{ for } 1 \le i \le N-2 \\
    1 / h^2 & \mbox{ if } j = i+1, \mbox{ for } 1 \le i \le N-2 \\
    0 & \mbox{ for all other } i, j
    \end{cases}.
    $$

	In particular, the first and final rows of the matrix are all zeros.

    You may want to use the following python code to "assemble" the matrix $A$:

    ``` python
    def make_heat_matrix(N):
        # initialise matrix
        A = np.zeros((N, N))
        h = 1.0 / (N - 1)

        # fill entries
        for i in range(1, N - 1):
            A[i][i - 1] = 1.0 / h ** 2
            A[i][i] = -2.0 / h ** 2
            A[i][i + 1] = 1.0 / h ** 2

        return A
    ```

    a.  Given the system of differential equations, what condition must be imposed on the initial value to ensure that we get the correct values for $x_0(t)$ and $x_{N-1}(t)$? How does that ensure we model these values correctly? **\[1 mark\]**

    b.  Set $N = 10$ and $\vec{x}^{(0)} = (20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 80)^T$. Take 10 steps of the Euler method to compute the solution at the final time $T=10$ (i.e., take $\mathrm{d}t = 1.0$ and use the code `eulerN` from the lectures). What values do you get? Do you trust your solution? Why? **\[2 mark\]**

    c.  Repeat the experiment for $\mathrm{d}t = 2^{-1}, 2^{-2}, 2^{-3}, \ldots$ until you find a solution that you trust. Which is the largest value of $\mathrm{d}t$ of the form $2^{-k}$ that you trust? **\[1 mark\]**

    You have (hopefully) found that the Euler method is not very reliable for this problem. The reason is that the Euler method is not well suited to so-called *stiff* equations.

    A method better suited to stiff differential equations is the **implicit Euler** method. For a system of differential equations $y' = f(y, t)$, the method says to take the update formula

	$$
    y^{(i+1)} = y^{(i)} + \mathrm{d}t f(y^{(i+1)}, t).
    $$

    For our heat problem, this corresponds to:

	$$
    \vec{x}^{(i+1)} = \vec{x}^{(i)} + \mathrm{d}t A \vec{x}^{(i+1)},
    $$

	which we can rearrange to:

	$$
    (I_N - \mathrm{d}t A) \vec{x}^{(i+1)} = \vec{x}^{(i)}.
    $$

    d.  Implement the implicit Euler method for our heat problem. Your function should take arguments $N$, the size of the system; $\mathrm{d}t$, the step size; $\vec{x}^{(0)}$, the initial value; and $T$, the final time and return the value of `x` at the final time step. Which is the best choice of linear solver from those studied in the course for large $N$ and small $\mathrm{d}t$? Why? Use this choice of linear solver in your implementation and include your code in your submission. **\[3 marks\]**

    e.  Set $N = 10$ and $\vec{x}^{(0)} = (20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 80)^T$. Take 10 steps of the implicit Euler method to compute the solution at the final time $T=10$ (i.e., take $\mathrm{d}t = 1.0$ and use the code from part d.). What values do you get? **\[1 mark\]**

    f.  Make a table of the run time (i.e., how long it takes to run your code) of calling your function from part d.Â for $(N, \mathrm{d}t) = (10 \times 2^k, 2^{-2k})$ for $k = 0, 1, 2, 3$. The columns of the table should be `N`, `dt`, `time` and `ratio` (the ratio of subsequent run times). For starting values you should take $\vec{x}^{(0)} = (20, 20, 20, \ldots, 20, 80)^T$. What do you think is the ratio should be for your implementation? Why? Comment on the difference between what you expected and what you observed. **\[3 marks\]**
