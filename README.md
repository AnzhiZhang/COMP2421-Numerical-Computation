# Course contents

-   **Vectors and matrices**: introduction and justification; vector and matrix operations; identity matrix; inverse of a matrix.

-   **Approximation and errors**: modelling and mathematical modelling; discrete and continuous models; floating point and rounding errors; balancing accuracy and efficiency.

-   **Static systems**: iterative methods for solving nonlinear scalar equations; methods for solving linear systems of equations; systems without unique solutions.

-   **Evolving systems**: derivatives and rates of change; initial value problems; stability and convergence of computer models.

# Module components

**Lectures**

2 hours per week via Zoom

**Tutorials**

1 hour per week face to face (see timetable)

**Homework and coursework exercise**

These will be provided *weekly* throughout the semester.

Courseworks are designed to give practice and reinforce the lectures. Coursework material is examinable.

# Assessment

## Examination

On-line assessment in January. The length of the exam and precise format is still to be confirm. The exam is worth 60% of the credit for the module.

## Summative coursework

There are two pieces of coursework for this module. Each is worth 20% of your module grade. Coursework will be submitted via Gradescope. The dates are tentative at this stage and are subject to change.

  Coursework   Date set      Submission deadline   Feedback date
  ------------ ------------- --------------------- -----------------
  1            11 October    4 November            18 November
  2            22 November   9 December            after Christmas

Late submission will only be allowed up to 1 week after the submission deadline to allow feedback to be returned in a reasonable time frame.

## Formative homework

There will be weekly homework assignment sheets. These are not for credit. You can check your understanding by submitting answers via Gradescope. Additional feedback will be given through the release of worked solutions and in tutorial sessions.
