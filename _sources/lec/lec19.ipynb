    "\n",
    "-   Overdetermined systems are common in data modelling and they typically have no solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Even so, it is possible to find a *closest* solution to the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   It is common to measure this closeness in the Euclidean norm and this leads naturally to the least squares approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   A solution to this problem can be found by solving the normal equations but can must be taken to use arithmetic with sufficient precision and specialised algorithms.\n",
