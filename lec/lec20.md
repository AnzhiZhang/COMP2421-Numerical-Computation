# Lecture 20: Overview, review and looking forward


## Exam in January

Monday 23 January, 9am

Computer Exam 1

### Computer Exam 1

You will be in a room on campus with a *Windows* university machine.

You will have access to:

- Minerva
- Gradescope
- Notes (comp2421-numerical-computation.gitlab.io/book)
- Jupyter
    - Binder **It is your responsibility to ensure the extenal service is available**
    - Apps anywhere  (see next slide)

You should bring:

- University ID card

Ahead of the exam you should read the [university guidence](https://students.leeds.ac.uk/info/10111/assessment/858/on_campus_examinations_preparation_and_arrangements).

### AppsAnywhere

[KB0014827: Getting started with AppsAnywhere](https://leeds.service-now.com/it?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0014827#using)

**It is your responsibility to test you can open Jupyter Notebook via AppsAnywhere before the exam**

You can do this by:

- visiting a Windows cluster
- [KB0014379: Using Windows Virtual Desktop (WVD)](https://it.leeds.ac.uk/it?id=kb_article&sysparm_article=KB0014379)

You should ensure any files you require are already available before the exam

### Past papers

Last years past paper will be available soon.

Some exams from recent years are on minerva

-   These were set by someone else
-   They were closed book
-   They are too long
-   Ignore questions on Newton interpolation.

### Additional help

### Examinable material

In this module **everything** may be assessed:

-   All material in lectures;

-   All algorithmic details contained within the sample codes (that accompany the lectures, worksheets or coursework);

-   All material in formative worksheets and summative courseworks.

### What's expected and what to expect

I will expect you to be **able to apply** and **understand** all of the algorithms discussed:

-   I will expect you to understand when to use an algorithm.

-   I will expect you to understand how to analyse an algorithm either based on the algorithm itself or numerical results from the algorithm.

-   I will expect you to be able to understand variations and generalisations of algorithms, and to implement them.

-   I will expect you to understand and apply simple derivatives.

    -   How to find a best fit solution
    -   When to choose which curve (from a simple choice)
    -   Problems with our approach

### Python

For this module, you are expected to be able to read, understand and construct simple scripts and functions, to implement simple algorithms, or to modify algorithms for your needs, and to be able to present and interpret the outputs from these. To this end, you should be familiar with elementary python notation and syntax (in particular, vectors, matrices, indices, loops and branches).

## What next....?

-   You will apply ideas from this course in many areas of computer science including

    -   graphics;
    -   artificial intelligence/machine learning.

-   There are plenty of opportunities for Final Year Projects on topics in numerical computation. If you are interested talk to me (or your tutorial leader).

-   There are also funded places for further study in numerical computation....

**Thank you for your attention!**

Good luck with your exam and future studies

I hope you have a good Christmas break!
