## Assessment

```{table} Assessment schedule
| Title       | Release date | Due date             | Credit |
|-------------|--------------|----------------------|--------|
| Portfolio   | Mon 2 Oct    | weekly, Tuesday 2pm  | 20%    |
| Coursework  | Mon 4 Dec    | Wed 10 Dec, 2pm      | 80%    |
| Formative 1 | Mon 9 Oct    | Wed 25 Oct, 2pm      | 0%     |
| Formative 2 | Mon  15 Nov  | Wed 29 Nov, 2pm      | 0%     |
```

 The dates are tentative at this stage and are subject to change.

### Portfolio (20%)

- A question similar to each worksheet is available in minerva each week.
- You will have to submit your answer (and show your working) by the Tuesday 2pm deadline.
- You will receive two mark for giving the correct numerical and one mark for your working.
- The best 6 of 8 will count for your final mark.
- No late submission allowed.

```{table} Portfolio deadlines

| Section | Deadline         |
|---------|------------------|
| 1       | Tue 17 Oct, 2pm  |
| 2       | Tue 24 Oct, 2pm  |
| 3       | Tue 7 Nov, 2pm   |
| 4       | Tue 14 Nov, 2pm  |
| 5       | Tue 21 Nov, 2pm  |
| 6       | Tue 28 Nov, 2pm  |
| 7       | Tue 5 Dec, 2pm   |
| 8       | Tue 12 Dec, 2pm  |
```

### Summative coursework (80%)

A single piece of summative coursework will count for the majority of the assessment of this module (80%).
You will be asked an open ended question which allows you to explore one of the topics from the module in detail.
The rubric that you will be marked against is available in minerva.
The coursework will be submitted via Gradescope.
Usual late submission rules apply.

### Formative coursework

There will be two additional formative courseworks which you can use to build skills related to the summative coursework.
Submission and feedback mechanism details to be confirmed.

## Syllabus

This is a rough breakdown of topics to be covered this semester. Please note that this is not entirely fixed and I cannot guarantee to follow this precise structure.
